<b>1.Research on Sexual Harassment in the Workplace</b><br>
<p><i>Out of 600 about 20 per cent of the working women were illiterate. About 18, 5, 14 and 13 per cent of the respondents were educated up to primary, middle school, S.S.C. and H.S.S.C. level respectively. About 19 per cent of them were graduates and about 9 per cent post-graduates. It is observed that majority of illiterate women were employed in unorganised sector both in urban and rural areas, those with primary education were mostly found in unorganised sector both in rural and urban areas. Women with S.S.C. and H.S.C. qualifications were engaged in organised and unorganised sectors but majority of them were in urban areas. Women with graduate or post-graduate qualification were mostly from urban areas and were engaged in organised sector.
Nearly two-third of the women respondents were Hindus, 17 per cent were Boudhas and about 11 per cent were Muslims. <br><br>
.The member of respondents following other religions was nominal. Communitywise distribution of respondents disclosed that respondents from backward class communities were in majority i.e. SC (28 per cent), ST (13 per cent), VJNT 96 per cent) and OBC (28 per cent). Respondents of Advanced Communities were only 25 per cent.  <br><br>
Majority of 59 per cent of the respondents had their place of residence in cities and towns and 41 per cent in villages. About 62 per cent of them were having nuclear families, 34 per cent had joint families and about 4 per cent were living alone. About 10 per cent of the respondents were not living with the family as they were employed at distant place.
The 600 women respondents were working in different type of organisations.  <br><br>
About 25 per cent of them were working in Government offices and 4 per cent in public enterprises. Nearly 28 per cent women respondents were employed in private offices, business establishments, service establishments and industrial houses. About 28 per cent women were working as labourers in construction industry, factories, agricultural operations and other activities.  <br><br>
The analysis of job status revealed that only about 4 per cent of the respondents each were placed in managerial cadre and Supervisory cadre, 17 per cent in clerical cadre, 8 per cent in class IV cadre and 35 per cent as labourers. About 11 per cent respondents were in teaching profession and around 6 per cent in health services. Nearly 10 per cent of the women respondents were domestic workers i.e. maid servants.
Nearly 30 per cent of the respondents had less than 5 years service to their credit and remaining 70 per cent were in employment for 5 or more than 5 years. <br><br>
Majority (about 94 per cent) of the working women had their working hours during day-time and about 4 per cent had to work after midnight. Out of 600 working women about 62 per cent had a feeling of safety and security at work place. Majority (about 60 per cent) had good relations with their male coworkers. For the purpose of this study the sexual harassment of women at work place has been defined as any unwelcome sexually determined behaviour like (a) physical contact (b) demand or request for sexual favour (c) sexually coloured remarks (d) showing pornography and (e) verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature.

<b>2.RESEARCH METHODS USED TO EXAMINE SEXUAL HARASSMENT</b><br>
<p><i>The goal of providing recommendations for preventing sexual harassment and mitigating its effects in academic science, engineering, and medicine requires evidence-based research. 
Different studies have different strengths and weaknesses, and these should be kept in mind when reviewing their findings, particularly if leaders in academic institutions, legislators, and researchers hope to design meaningful and effective interventions and policies. 
The two most commonly used study methods are surveys and laboratory experiments. 
<br><br>Important findings have also emerged using in-depth interviews, case studies, sociolegal analyses, and other methods. When conducting or reviewing research examining sexual harassment, it is crucial that the methods used to conduct the research match the goals for the research. It is crucial to note that the prevalence of sexual harassment in a population is best estimated using representative surveys and not by relying on the invariably lower number of official reports of sexual harassment made to an organization (see the discussion in Chapter 4 about how rare it is for women to formally report their experience). The next sections discuss these various research methods and the kind of information they provide.
</i></p>

<b>3.EXPERIMENTAL METHODS</b>
<p><i> Another way that information has been gathered about sexual harassment has been through laboratory experiments, in which researchers examine the occurrence of sexually harassing behaviors by manipulating variables under controlled conditions. The advantage of this approach is that researchers can directly observe sexually harassing behavior. 
This approach, however, does not provide information on the prevalence of sexual harassment.<br><br>

Some of the behaviors that have been directly observed in experiments include the following:
<br><br>
# Unsolicited touching from peers (Pryor 1987);<br>
# Sending unsolicited pornographic materials electronically (Dall'Ara and Maass 1999; Maass et al. 2003);<br>
# Sending sexist jokes electronically (Galdi, Maass, and Cadinu 2014);<br>
# Sending sexual come-ons electronically (Diehl, Rees, and Bohner 2012);<br>
# Asking sexist questions in an interview (Hitlan et al. 2009); and<br>
# Sexualized behavior, such as staring at a woman's body, during an interview (Rudman and Borgida 1995).<br>
</i></p>

<b>4.LMTATIONS AND GAP</b>
<i><p>
  Sexual harassment encompasses a wide range of behaviors and is not easily defined. Survey
evidence has been instrumental in raising public awareness about the extent of workplace
sexual harassment. The substantial evidence that sexual harassment is frequent and damaging
to individuals and workplaces has led to widespread legislation and workplace policies.<br><br>

However, the survey instruments differ widely in design from study to study, as do the
sampled populations. Existing data do not permit making valid crosscountry or cross
cultural comparisons or even identifying trends within a country. The limited reliable
trend evidence indicates that sexual harassment has not declined, but whether that is due
to increased awareness of what behaviors constitute sexual harassment or to no actual
change in harassing behavior is uncertain [1]. In addition, the trend data are now outdated,
with the most recent survey conducted in 1994 [1].<br><br>
The connection between sexual harassment and other forms of workplace harassment,
including bullying, warrants further examination. Little is known about the characteristics
and motivation of harassers and therefore little is known about how to prevent harassment.
And although sexual harassment is found to be more likely when organizations tolerate such
behavior, there is little specific empirical evidence on what organizational policies or actions
are effective in eliminating sexual harassment.

<b>5.PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
</b>
<i><p>
  Sudies on sexual harassment from the 1980s through today continue to show that sexual harassment of women is widespread in workplaces and that the rates of sexual harassment have not significantly decreased. Studies have also identified common characteristics of sexual harassment in different workplaces and uncovered characteristics of workplaces that are associated with higher rates of sexual harassment. This section and the next one review what research can tell us about the trends in sexual harassment rates over time and what the common characteristics are of sexual harassment and sexually harassing environments.
<br><br>
Wherever possible, the report cites the most recent scientific studies of a topic. That said, the empirical research into sexual harassment, using rigorous scientific methods, dates back to the 1980s. This report cites conclusions from the earlier work when those results reveal historical trends or patterns over time. It also cites results from earlier studies when there is no theoretical reason to expect findings to have changed with the passage of time. For example, the inverse relationship between sexual harassment and job satisfaction is a robust one: the more an individual is harassed on the job, the less she or he likes that job. That basic finding has not changed over the course of 30 years, and there is no reason to expect that it will.
<br><br>
To access the trends in prevalence for sexual harassment, ideally we would examine longitudinal data that uses a well-validated behavior-based instrument for different workplaces and industries; unfortunately, this data is not available. The U.S. Merit System Protection Board (USMSPB) was one of the first organizations to study sexual harassment, with a focus on the federal workforce, which includes a variety of job types and workplace environments. The USMSPB surveys, conducted in 1980, 1987, 1994, and 2016, asked scientifically selected samples of federal workers about their experiences of specific forms of sexual harassment7 at work in the past 24 months. These surveys used behavioral questions; however, they did not use the SEQ, and in earlier years the survey did not ask about nonsexualized forms of gender harassment such as sexist comments, which are known to be the most common form of sexual harassment (Kabat-Farr and Cortina 2014). As a result, this is not a good source of longitudinal data covering all three forms of sexual harassment.

<b>6.CHARACTERISTICS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUALLY HARASSING ENVIRONMENTS
</b>
<p><i>
  Rigorous survey research has identified common characteristics of sexual harassment. 
  This work pushes against some of the main assumptions made on what it is, as well as how sexual harassment affects the targets, the bystanders, and the atmosphere of work and education settings. Here the chapter describes some of the aspects of sexual harassment that are strongly supported by the literature. However, we note that the data on varying experiences of sexual harassment of women of color, sexual minorities, and gender minorities is sparse, so these characteristics are likely to reflect the experience of majority women.
