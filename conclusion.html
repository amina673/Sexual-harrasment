<i><b>Thus we understand that  <br> </b>
Based on the responses gathered through the questionnaire, it is clear that <b>Sexual Harassment</b> continues to persist in various forms within the school environment, workplace, etc. <br> <br>
<b>Despite decades of attention</b>, legal action, and advocacy, this analysis of data, research, and experience shows that sexual harassment remains a serious and pervasive problem across virtually all industry sectors and workplaces. <br> <br>
We found that no sector remains untouched by sexual harassment, nor unaffected by its impacts: <br> <br> 
<b>Sexual harassment</b> damages the lives, health, financial independence, and opportunities of countless victims, and costs businesses not only in legal fees, but in lost productivity, morale, effectiveness, and talent.<br><br>
Sexual harassment is about the interplay of power and gender present in every sector of the economy at virtually every level. While the data clearly shows that across all sectors, women of lower status are the most common targets of sexual harassment by perpetrators who are typically men of higher status, sexual harassment is by no means limited to this dynamic.<br><br>
<b>Men </b>, particularly those who don’t conform to traditional masculine norms, and others seen as outsiders, like LGBTQ and gender nonconforming people, are often targets and women can be harassers. A sexually harassing culture can become so normalized that no one recognizes it, or doesn’t object to it for fear of being labeled a troublemaker and losing employment or status in the workplace. <br><br>
And harassment can come sideways, from co-workers, or from third parties like clients, customers, or patients.
